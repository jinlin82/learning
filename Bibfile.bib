  abstract =	 "Gompertz curve has been used to estimate the number
                  of residual faults in testing phases of software
                  development, especially by Japanese software
                  development companies. Since the Gompertz curve is a
                  deterministic function, the curve cannot be applied
                  to estimating software reliability which is the
                  probability that software system does not fail in a
                  prefixed time period. In this article, we propose a
                  stochastic model called the Gompertz software
                  reliability model based on non-homogeneous Poisson
                  processes. The proposed model can be derived from
                  the statistical theory of extreme-value, and has a
                  similar asymptotic property to the deterministic
                  Gompertz curve. Also, we develop an \{EM\} algorithm
                  to determine the model parameters effectively. In
                  numerical examples with software failure data
                  observed in real software development projects, we
                  evaluate performance of the Gompertz software
                  reliability model in terms of reliability assessment
                  and failure prediction. "
